This directory contains files used to package bowscoind/bowscoin-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile bowscoind/bowscoin-Qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

bowscoin: URI support
--------------------

bowscoin-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install bowscoin-qt.desktop
  sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your bowscoin-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/bitcoin128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps

bowscoin-qt.protocol (KDE)
